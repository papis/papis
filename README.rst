Papis is a powerful and highly extensible CLI document and bibliography manager.

|first_glance|

With Papis, you can search your library for books and papers, add documents and notes, import and export to and from other formats, and much much more. Papis uses a human-readable and easily hackable ``.yaml`` file to store each entry's bibliographical data. It strives to be easy to use while providing a wide range of features. And for those who still want more, Papis makes it easy to write scripts that extend its features even further.

Features
--------

- **Add documents** and automatically fetch their metadata.
- **Search** by author, title, tags, and so on.
- **Synchronize** your library with whatever software you're already using.
- **Share** your documents with colleagues without having to force some proprietary service onto them.
- **Import** your data from other bibliography managers.
- **Export** to BibTeX and other formats.
- **Integrate with your editor** with plugins for (Neo)vim and Emacs.
- **TUIs** make it easy to get a quick overview of your library.
- **Use the web app** when the CLI doesn't quite cut it (for example on your tablet).
- **Hacking** Papis is easy! Use the API to easily create your own custom python scripts.

Quick tour
----------

Install Papis with pip (or `one of the alternatives <https://papis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__):

.. code:: bash

    pip install papis

Let's download a couple of documents:

.. code:: bash

    wget http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/pdf/libc.pdf
    wget http://www.ams.org/notices/201304/rnoti-p434.pdf

We can now add these to the (default) library. This will automatically query for the metadata associated with the ``doi``.

.. code:: bash

    papis add --from doi 10.1090/noti963 rnoti-p434.pdf

|add|

You can also use ``--set`` to add information:

.. code:: bash

    papis add libc.pdf --set author "Sandra Loosemore" \
                       --set title "GNU C reference manual" \
                       --set year 2018 \
                       --set tags programming \
                       --confirm

Now open an attached file or edit an entry:

.. code:: bash

    papis open
    papis edit


|edit|

Or export them to bibtex:

.. code:: bash

    papis export --all --format bibtex > mylib.bib

|bibtex_export|

Papis also includes a web app that you can start with:

.. code:: bash

    papis serve

You can then open the indicated address (``http://localhost:8888``) in your browser.

|web_app|

All Papis commands come with help messages:

.. code:: bash

    papis -h      # General help
    papis add -h  # Help with a specific Papis command
