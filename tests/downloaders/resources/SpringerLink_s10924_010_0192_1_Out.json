  "abstract": "Amylose containing polysaccharides are one of the most abundant and inexpensive naturally occurring biopolymers. Therefore, they are one of the most promising candidates to produce substitute plastics, especially in packaging applications. To determine the suitability for packaging applications, cytotoxicity of a modified amylose based bioplastic was investigated using NIH 3T3 Fibroblast cells from observation of cell morphology and MTS assay. Chemical durability of the amylose based bioplastic film was also studied by ion release and pH measurement after immersing the film into water. In&nbsp;vitro cytotoxicity (Cell morphology study and MTS assay) showed that the amylose based bioplastic film has in&nbsp;vitro biocompatibility and can be used for packaging applications. The ion release and pH measurement also supported the results.",
