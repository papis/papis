The method is completely parameter-free and does not require analytical functional approximations. Instead, the proposed method is based on the idea that atoms are meaningful pieces of a molecule and thus, a promolecule, build from frozen spherical atomic entities, serves as a suitable model for the latter. This idea is imposed on the physical equations, originating from density functional theory converted into a bifunctional formalism. The viewpoint proposed in this study offers a new strategic way of subsequent approximation levels in orbital-free density functional theory. In this work the zeroth order approximation is shown to predict chemical bonding in molecules, providing a concept of the chemical bond without involving orbitals.", "pii": "S2210271X18305656", "date": "2018-11-15", "language": "en", "type": "article", "accepted-date": "20 October 2018", "author_list": [{"given": "Kati", "family": "Finzel", "affiliation": [{"name": "Faculty of Chemistry and Food Chemistry, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Bergstra\u00dfe 66, 01069 Dresden, Germany"}]}], "title": "Chemical bonding without orbitals", "journal": "Computational and Theoretical Chemistry", "pages": "50--55", "year": "2018"}
