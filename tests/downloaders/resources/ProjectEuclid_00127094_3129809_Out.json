  "abstract": "We prove that an n×n random matrix G with independent entries is completely delocalized. Suppose that the entries of G have zero means, variances uniformly bounded below, and a uniform tail decay of exponential type. Then with high probability all unit eigenvectors of G have all coordinates of magnitude O(n−1/2), modulo logarithmic corrections. This comes as a consequence of a new, geometric approach to delocalization for random matrices.",
