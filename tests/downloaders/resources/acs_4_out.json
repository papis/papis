  "abstract": "The exact mechanism of angiogenesis by europium hydroxide nanorods was unclear. In this study we have showed that formation of reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and O2·−) is involved in redox signaling pathways during angiogenesis, important for cardiovascular and ischemic diseases. Here we used single-walled carbon nanotube sensor array to measure the single-molecule efflux of H2O2 and a HPLC method for the determination of O2·– from endothelial cells in response to proangiogenic factors. Additionally, reactive oxygen species-mediated angiogenesis using inorganic nanorods was observed in transgenic (fli1a:EGFP) zebrafish embryos.",
