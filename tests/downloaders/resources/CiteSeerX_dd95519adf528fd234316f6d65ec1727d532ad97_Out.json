  "abstract": "We describe an algorithm for solving nonlinear optimization problems with lower  and upper bounds that constrain the variables. The algorithm uses projected gradients  to construct a limited memory BFGS matrix and determine a step direction. The  algorithm has been implemented and distributed as part of the Toolkit for Advanced  Optimization (TAO). We include numerical results demonstrate is eectiveness on a set  of large test problems and its scalability to multiple processors.",
