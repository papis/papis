However, if one uses βη-conversion to prove equivalence of programs, then a gross simplification 1 is introduced. We give a calculus based on a categorical semantics for computations, which provides a correct basis for proving equivalence of programs, independent from any specific computational model.","bibtex":"test_bibtex","authors":["Eugenio Moggi"],"journal":"","publish_time":"0","source":"","urls":[],"cluster_id":"NJgL0YMByhvPsGt1qCbz"}}
