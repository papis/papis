The algorithm uses projected gradients  to construct a limited memory BFGS matrix and determine a step direction. The  algorithm has been implemented and distributed as part of the Toolkit for Advanced  Optimization (TAO). We include numerical results demonstrate is eectiveness on a set  of large test problems and its scalability to multiple processors.","bibtex":"test_bibtex","authors":["Steven J. Benson","Jorge J.
