  "abstract": "[CHANGE: This is the layout of the published version]\n•\tThe theory of grammar-changes as a result of Darwinian cognitive evolution correctly models directions and outcomes of grammar changes.\n•\tThe unidirectional changes of grammars trade in 'cheap' procedural routines for 'costly' declarative content.\n•\tSOV and SVO languages are systems in a rather stable equilibrium. Most changes involve \"free word order languages\" (= Type 3) that change to OV or VO in the course of constraining the linking directionality of lexical phrasal heads. \n•\t[S[VO]] is a point of no return in diachronic grammar development.\n•\t[S[VO]] is a diachronically more recent clause structure than SOV or Type 3.",
