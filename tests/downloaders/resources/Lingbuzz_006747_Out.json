Most changes involve \"free word order languages\" (= Type 3) that change to OV or VO in the course of constraining the linking directionality of lexical phrasal heads. \n\u2022\t[S[VO]] is a point of no return in diachronic grammar development.\n\u2022\t[S[VO]] is a diachronically more recent clause structure than SOV or Type 3.",
