  "abstract": "The λ-calculus is considered an useful mathematical tool in the study of programming languages. However, if one uses βη-conversion to prove equivalence of programs, then a gross simplification 1 is introduced. We give a calculus based on a categorical semantics for computations, which provides a correct basis for proving equivalence of programs, independent from any specific computational model.",
