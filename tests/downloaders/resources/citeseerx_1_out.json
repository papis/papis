  "abstract": "CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): The λ-calculus is considered an useful mathematical tool in the study of programming languages, since programs can be identified with λ-terms.  However, if one goes further and uses fij-conversion to prove equivalence of programs, then a gross simplification is introduced, that may jeopardise the applicability of theoretical results to real situations. In this paper we introduce a new calculus based on a categorical semantics for computations.  This calculus provides a correct basis for proving equivalence of programs, independent from any specific computational model."
