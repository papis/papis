General settings
----------------

.. papis-config:: local-config-file

    Name AND relative path of the local configuration file that papis
    will additionally read if the file is present in the current
    directory or in the base directory of a given library.

    This is useful, for instance, if you have a library somewhere
    for which you want special configuration settings
    but do not want these settings to cluster in your configuration
    file. It is also useful if you're sharing a library with someone
    else and you want them to have the same settings in that library as
    you. Imagine you're sharing a library of datasheets with your friend
    Fulano. You have your library at

    ::

        ~/Documents/lib-with-fulano

    and you've set a local configuration file there

    ::

        ~/Documents/lib-with-fulano/.papis.config

    then whenever Fulano uses that library and the file is also present,
    his papis program will also read the configuration settings at
    the path above.

.. papis-config:: dir-umask

    This is the default ``umask`` that will be used to create the new
    documents' directories.

.. papis-config:: use-git

    Some commands will issue git commands if this option is set to ``True``.
    For example in ``mv`` or ``rename``.

.. papis-config:: browse-query-format

    The query string that is to be searched for in the ``browse`` command
    whenever a search engine is used.

.. papis-config:: search-engine

    Search engine to be used by some commands like ``browse``.

.. papis-config:: user-agent

    User agent used by papis whenever it obtains information from external
    servers.

.. papis-config:: scripts-short-help-regex

    This is the format of the short help indicator in external papis
    commands.

.. papis-config:: info-name

    The default name of the information files.

.. papis-config:: doc-url-key-name

    Some documents might have, apart from an url, also a file url associated with them.
    The key name appearing in the information file is defined by
    this setting.

.. papis-config:: default-library

    The name of the library that is to be searched when ``papis``
    is run without library arguments.

.. papis-config:: format-doc-name

    This setting controls the name of the document in the papis format strings
    like in format strings such as ``match-format`` or ``header-format``.
    For instance, if you are managing videos, you might want to
    set this option to ``vid`` in order to set  the ``header-format`` to
    ``{doc[title]} - {doc[director]} - {doc[duration]}``.

.. papis-config:: match-format

    Default format that is used to match a document against in order to select
    it. For example if the ``match-format`` is equal to
    ``{doc[year]} {doc[author]}`` then the title of a document will not work
    to match a document, only the year and author.

.. papis-config:: header-format

    Default format that is used to show a document in order to select it.

.. papis-config:: header-format-file

    This option should have the path of a file with the ``header-format``
    template. Sometimes templates can get big so this is a way
    of not cluttering the config file with text.

    As an example you would set

    .. code:: ini

        [papers]

        header-format-file = ~/.papis/config/styles/header.txt

.. papis-config:: info-allow-unicode

    This flag is to be set if you want to allow unicode characters
    in your info file or not. If it is set to false then a representation
    for the unicode characters will be written in its place.
    Since we should be living in an unicode world, it is set to ``True``
    by default.

Tools options
-------------

.. papis-config:: opentool

    This is the general program that will be used to open documents.
    As for now papis is not intended to detect the type of document to be opened
    and decide upon how to open the document. You should set this
    to the right program for the tool. If you are on linux you might want
    to take a look at `ranger <http://ranger.nongnu.org>`_ or let
    the default handle it in your system.
    For mac users you might set this to ``open``.

.. papis-config:: browser
    :default: $BROWSER

    Program to be used for opening websites, the default is the environment
    variable ``$BROWSER``.

.. papis-config:: picktool

    This is the program used whenever papis asks you to pick a document
    or options in general.

    Only option is:
        - papis

.. papis-config:: editor
    :default: $EDITOR

    Editor used to edit files in papis, e.g., for the ``papis edit``
    command. It defaults to the ``$EDITOR`` environment variable, if this is
    not set then it will default to the ``$VISUAL`` environment variable.
    Otherwise the default editor in your system will be used.

.. papis-config:: file-browser

    File browser to be used when opening a directory. It defaults to the
    default file browser in your system, however, you can set it to different
    file browsers such as ``dolphin``, ``thunar`` or ``ranger`` just to name a few.


Bibtex options
--------------

.. papis-config:: bibtex-journal-key

  Journal publishers may request abbreviated journal titles. This
  option allows the user to set the key for the journal entry when using
  ``papis export --bibtex``.

  Set as ``full_journal_title`` or ``abbrev_journal_title`` for
  whichever style required. Default is ``journal``.

.. papis-config:: extra-bibtex-keys
  :default: []

  When exporting documents in bibtex format, you might want to add
  non-standard bibtex keys such as ``doc_url`` or ``tags``. You can add
  these as a valid python list of strings, for instance:

  .. code:: ini

    [mylib]
    extra-bibtex-keys = ["tags", "doc_url"]

.. papis-config:: extra-bibtex-types
  :default: []

  Allow non-standard bibtex types to be recognized, e.g,

  .. code:: ini

    [mylib]
    extra-bibtex-types = ["wikipedia", "video", "song"]

  See
  `bibtex
  reference <http://mirror.easyname.at/ctan/biblio/bibtex/base/btxdoc.pdf>`_.

.. papis-config:: multiple-authors-format

    When retrieving automatic author information from services like
    crossref.org, papis usually builds the ``author`` field for the
    given document. The format how every single author name is built
    is given by this setting, for instance you could customize it
    by the following:

    ::

        multiple-authors-format = {au[surname]} -- {au[given_name]}

    which would given in the case of Albert Einstein the string
    ``Einstein -- Albert``.

.. papis-config:: multiple-authors-separator

    Similarly to ``multiple-authors-format``, this is the string that
    separates single authors in the ``author`` field. If it is set to
    `` and `` then you would have ``<author 1> and <author 2> and ....``
    in the ``author`` field.

.. papis-config:: bibtex-unicode

    Whether or not to allow direct unicode characters in the document
    fields to be exported into the bibtex text.

.. _add-command-options:

``papis add`` options
---------------------

.. papis-config:: ref-format

    This flag is set to change the ``ref`` flag in the info.yaml file
    when a document is imported. For example: I prefer the format
    FirstAuthorYear e.g. Plews2019. This would be achieved by the
    following:

    ::

        ref-format = {doc[author_list][0][surname]}{doc[year]}

    In general however I recomment the default behaviour of just using the
    ``author`` key of the document, i.e.,
    ::

        ref-format = {doc[title]:.15} {doc[author]:.6} {doc[year]}

    The spaces in the value of the format will be important in order
    to capitalize the string, i.e., if you have a title like
    ``STUDIES ABOUT EARTH AND HIMMEL`` and and an author list like
    ``mesh-ki-ang-nuna`` then the built reference will be
    ``StudiesAboutEMeshKi``.

    .. note::
        Special characters will be replaced when generating the ``ref`` entry
        (e.g.  ``Ö → O``, ``.`` and other symbols will be striped from the
        string). 

    If you want to add some punctuation, dots (``.``) and underscores (``_``)
    can be escaped by a backslash. For example,

    ::

        ref-format = {doc[author_list][0][surname]}\.{doc[year]}

    would result in 'Plews.2019'. To ensure correct capitalization you might
    consider inserting whitespaces after an escaped character.

.. papis-config:: add-confirm

    If set to ``True``, every time you run ``papis add``
    the flag ``--confirm`` will be added automatically. If is set to ``True``
    and you add it, i.e., you run ``papis add --confirm``, then it will
    fave the contrary effect, i.e., it will not ask for confirmation.

.. papis-config:: add-folder-name
    :default: empty string

    Default name for the folder of newly added documents. For example, if you want
    the folder of your documents to be named after the format
    ``author-title`` then you should set it to
    the papis format: ``{doc[author]}-{doc[title]}``.
    Per default a hash followed by the author name is created.

.. papis-config:: add-file-name

    Same as ``add-folder-name``, but for files, not folders. If it is not set,
    the names of the files will be cleaned and taken `as-is`.

.. papis-config:: add-interactive

    If set to ``True``, every time you run ``papis add``
    the flag ``--interactive`` will be added automatically. If is set to
    ``True`` and you add it, i.e., you run ``papis add --interactive``, then it
    will fave the contrary effect, i.e., it will not run in interactive mode.

.. papis-config:: add-edit

    If set to ``True``, every time you run ``papis add``
    the flag ``--edit`` will be added automatically. If it is set to
    ``True`` and you add something, i.e., you run ``papis add --edit``, then it
    will have the contrary effect, i.e., it will not prompt to edit the info
    file.

.. papis-config:: add-open

    If set to ``True``, every time you run ``papis add``
    the flag ``--open`` will be added automatically. If it is set to
    ``True`` and you add something, i.e., you run ``papis add --open``, then it
    will have the contrary effect, i.e., it will not open the attached files
    before adding the document to the library.

``papis browse`` options
------------------------

.. papis-config:: browse-key

    This command provides the key that is used to generate the
    url. For users that run ``papis add --from-doi``, setting browse-key
    to ``doi`` constructs the url from dx.doi.org/DOI, providing a
    much more accurate url.

    Default value is set to ``url``. If you need functionality
    with the ``search-engine`` option, set the option to an empty
    string e.g.  ::

        browse-key = ''

.. _edit-command-options:

``papis edit`` options
----------------------

.. papis-config:: notes-name

    In ``papis edit`` you can edit notes about the document. ``notes-name``
    is the default name of the notes file, which by default is supposed
    to be a TeX file.

.. _marks-options:

Marks
-----

.. papis-config:: open-mark

    If this option is set to ``True``, every time papis opens
    a document it will ask to open a mark first.
    If it is set to ``False``, then doing

    .. code::

        papis open --mark

    will avoid opening a mark.

.. papis-config:: mark-key-name

    This is the default key name for the marks in the info file. For
    example, if you set ``mark-key-name = bookmarks`` then you would have
    in your ``info.yaml`` file

    .. code::

        author: J. Krishnamurti
        bookmarks:
        - name: Chapter 1
          value: 120

.. papis-config:: mark-format-name

    This is the name of the mark to be passed to the options
    ``mark-header-format`` etc... E.g. if you set ``mark-format-name = m``
    then you could set ``mark-header-format = {m[value]} - {m[name]}``.

.. papis-config:: mark-header-format

    This is the format in which the mark will appear whenever the user
    has to pick one. You can change this in order to make ``marks`` work
    in the way you like. Per default it is assumed that every mark
    has a ``name`` and a ``value`` key.

.. papis-config:: mark-match-format

    Format in which the mark name has to match the user input.

.. papis-config:: mark-opener-format

    Due to the difficulty to generalize opening a general document
    at a given bookmark, the user should set this in whichever way
    it suits their needs. For example

    - If you are using the pdf viewer ``evince`` and you want to open a
      mark, you would use

        ::

            mark-opener-format = evince -p {mark[value]}

    - If you are using ``okular`` you would use

        ::

            mark-opener-format = okular -p {mark[value]}

    - If you are using ``zathura``, do

        ::

            mark-opener-format = zathura -P {mark[value]}

Downloaders
-----------

.. papis-config:: downloader-proxy

    There is the possibility of download papers using a proxy.
    To know more you can checkout this
    `link <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies>`_.

Databases
---------

.. papis-config:: default-query-string

    This is the default query that a command will take if no
    query string is typed in the command line. For example this is
    the query that is passed to the command ``open`` whenever no search
    string is typed:

    ::

        papis open

    Imagine you want to open all papers authored by ``John Smith`` whenever you do not
    specify an input query string, i.e., ``papis open``. Then setting

    ::

        default-query-string = author:"John Smith"

    would do the trick.
    Notice that the current example has been
    done assuming the ``database-backend = papis``.

.. papis-config:: database-backend

    The backend to use in the database. As for now papis supports
    the own database system ``papis`` and
    `whoosh <https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

.. papis-config:: use-cache

    Set to ``False`` if you do not want to use the ``cache``
    for the given library. This is only effective if you're using the
    ``papis`` database-backend.

.. papis-config:: cache-dir
  :default: $XDG_CACHE_HOME

.. papis-config:: whoosh-schema-fields

    Python list with the ``TEXT`` fields that should be included in the
    whoosh database schema. For instance, say that you want to be able
    to search for the ``doi`` and ``ref`` of the documents, then you could
    include

    ::

        whoosh-schema-fields = ['doi', 'ref']

.. papis-config:: whoosh-schema-prototype

    This is the model for the whoosh schema, check
    `the documentation <https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schema.html/>`_
    for more information.

Terminal user interface (picker)
--------------------------------

These options are for the terminal user interface (tui).
They are defined in the section ``tui`` which means that you can set them
in your configuration file globally like

.. code:: ini

    [tui]
    status_line_format = "F1: Help"
    ...

or inside the library sections prepending a ``tui-``,

.. code:: ini

    [papers]
    tui-status_line_format = "Library papers**
    ...

.. papis-config:: status_line_format
    :section: tui

    This is the format of the string that appears at the bottom in the
    status line.  Right now there are only two variables defined:

    - ``selected_index``
    - ``number_of_documents``

    Which are self-explanatory.

.. papis-config:: status_line_style
    :section: tui

    The style the status line should have.
    Examples are ``fg:#ff00aa bg:black`` etc...
    More information can be found
    `here
    <https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/pages/advanced_topics/styling.html/>`_
    .

.. papis-config:: message_toolbar_style
    :section: tui

    The style of the message toolbar, this toolbar is the one
    where messages of the ``echo`` command are rendered for instance.

.. papis-config:: options_list.selected_margin_style
    :section: tui

    Style of the margin of the selected document in the picker.

.. papis-config:: options_list.unselected_margin_style
    :section: tui

    Style of the margin of the unselected documents in the picker.
    If you don't want any coloring for them you can just set this setting
    to the empty string as such

    ::

        tui-options_list.unselected_margin_style =

.. papis-config:: error_toolbar_style
    :section: tui

    The style for the error messages.

.. papis-config:: editmode
    :section: tui

    Whenever the user is typing text, one can use either
    ``emacs`` like keybindings or ``vi``. If this does not tell you
    anything, you can just leave it as is.


.. papis-config:: move_down_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: move_up_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: move_down_while_info_window_active_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: move_up_while_info_window_active_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: focus_command_line_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: edit_document_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: open_document_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: show_help_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: show_info_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: go_top_key
    :section: tui

.. papis-config:: go_bottom_key
    :section: tui


Other
-----

.. papis-config:: unique-document-keys

    Whenever you add a new document, papis tries to figure out if
    you have already added this document before. This is partially done
    checking for some special keys, and checking if they match.
    Which keys are checked against is decided by this option, which
    should be formatted as a python list, just as in the default value.

    For instance, if you add a paper with a given ``doi``, and then you
    add another document with the same ``doi``, then papis will notify
    you that there is already another document with this ``doi`` because
    the ``doi`` key is part of the ``unique-document-keys`` option.

.. papis-config:: document-description-format

    ``papis`` sometimes will have to tell you which document it is processing
    through text, for instance, imagine you are updating a document

    .. code:: yaml

        author: Albert Einstein
        title: General Relativity

    and papis is doing something with it. Then if your
    ``document-description-format`` is set to
    ``{doc[title]} - {doc[author]}``, you will see that papis tells you

    ::

        .....
        Updating 'General Relativity - Albert Einstein'
        ...

    so you will know exactly what is going on.

.. papis-config:: sort-field

  As of version ``0.10``, some command line commands have the ``--sort`` option
  to sort the documents according to a given field. If you set
  ``sort-field`` in your configuration file, this will sort by default
  the documents according to this sort field. For instance,
  if you want your documents by default to be sorted by ``year``, you
  would set ``sort-field = year``.

.. papis-config:: time-stamp

  Wether or not to add a timestamp to a document when is being added to
  papis. If documents have a timestamp, then they will be sortable
  using `--sort time-added` option.

.. papis-config:: formater

    The formating language in python can be configured through plugins.

    .. autoclass:: papis.format.PythonFormater

    .. autoclass:: papis.format.Jinja2Formater
