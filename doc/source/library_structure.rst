The library structure
=====================

One of the things that makes papis interesting is the fact
that its library structure is nearly nonexistent.

A papis library is linked to a directory, where all the documents are (and
possibly sublibraries).  What papis does is simply to go to the library folder
and look for all subfolders that contain a information file, which by default
is a ``info.yaml`` file.

Every subfolder that has an ``info.yaml`` file in it is a valid papis document.
As an example let us consider the following library

::

  /home/fulano/Documents/papers/
  ├── folder1
  │   └── paper.pdf
  ├── folder2
  │   ├── folder3
  │   │   ├── info.yaml
  │   │   └── blahblahblah.pdf
  │   └── folder4
  │       ├── info.yaml
  │       └── output.pdf
  ├── classics
  │   └── folder5
  │       ├── info.yaml
  │       └── output.pdf
  ├── physics
  │   └── newton
  │       └── principia
  │           ├── document.pdf
  │           ├── supplements.pdf
  │           └── info.yaml
  └─── rpa
      └── bohm
          ├── info.yaml
          ├── notes.tex
          └── output.pdf

The first thing that you might notice is that there are really many folders of
course. Just to check that you undeerstand exactly what is a document, just
please think about which of these pdfs is not a valid papis document... That's
right!, ``folder1/paper.pdf`` is not a valid document since the folder1 does not
contain any ``info.yaml`` file. You see also that it does not matter how deep the
folder structure is, you can have in your library a ``physics`` folder, where you
have a ``newton`` folder, where also you have a folder containing the actual book
``document.pdf`` plus some supplementary information ``supplements.pdf``.  In this
case inside the ``info.yaml`` you would have the following ``file`` section

.. code:: yaml

  files:
  - document.pdf
  - supplements.pdf

so that you are telling papis that in this folder there are two relevant files.
