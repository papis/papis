Importing from bibtex or zotero
===============================

Many users will want to import a library from a bibtex file
that another program such as ``zotero``, ``mendeley`` or
``jabref`` will have exported. These programs usually have a
field called ``FILE`` or ``file`` that points to a path
where the document file can be found.

To import such a library you can use a provided script originally
intended for ``zotero`` which is, however, general enough to work
for other programs too.

To install this script you can install the project
`papis-zotero <https://github.com/papis/papis-zotero>`__ and follow the
instructions therein to import a bibliography file into papis.
