Using pip
---------

The easiest way of installing papis is using the ``PyPi`` repositories and
the package manager ``pip3``, just open a terminal and type in

::

  pip3 install papis

If you are on GNU/Linux like systems you might need to type ``sudo``

::

  sudo pip3 install papis

or if you prefer installing it locally then simply type

::

  pip3 install --user papis

You can also **update** papis with ``pip``

::

  pip3 install --upgrade papis


Archlinux
---------

- The package `papis` is also found in the archlinux repositories
  `here <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/papis/>`__.
- If you want to use the git version of ``papis`` instead
  refer to `papis-git <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/papis-git/>`__ package.

NixOS
-----

If you are running `NixOS <https://nixos.org/>`__ or you have the
`nix <https://github.com/NixOS/nix>`__ package manager installed, you can install
papis by running:

::

  nix-env -i papis

If you like papis, just clone the repository

::

  git clone git@github.com:papis/papis.git
  cd papis

and start hacking it with:

::

  nix-shell --expr 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; papis.overrideDerivation (drv: { src = ./.; })'

This command will provide you a shell with all the dependencies required.


From source
-----------

First of all you have to get the code, open a terminal and hit

::

  git clone https://github.com/papis/papis.git

or download the
`zip file <https://github.com/papis/papis/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>`__.


Go inside of the ``papis`` source folder and you can install it with ``python3``.

The general command that you have to hit is by using the ``setup.py`` script:

.. code:: python

  python3 setup.py install


Again, if you want to install it locally because you don't have administrative
rights on your computer you simply type

.. code:: python

  python3 setup.py install --user

If you want to work on the code, you can alternatively hit

.. code:: python

  python3 setup.py develop --user


.. warning::

  If you install the package locally, the program ``papis`` will be installed
  by default into your ``~/.local/bin`` directory, so that you will have to
  set your ``PATH`` accordingly.

  One way of doing this in ``bash`` shells (``Linux`` and the like, also
  ``Ubuntu`` on Windows or ``cygwin``) is by adding the following line to your
  ``~/.bashrc`` file
  ::

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin


Requirements
------------

Papis needs the following packages that are sometimes not installed with the
system ``python3`` distribution

::

    python3-setuptools

However if you have a general enough python distribution they should be
installed.


Running tests
-------------

In order to run the necessary tests to submit a pull request,
make sure that the following commands pass


::

  python -m pytest papis/ tests/ --cov=papis
  python -m mypy papis
  python -m flake8 papis

for it, make sure that you have ``pytest``, ``flake8`` and ``mypy``
installed.

You can make sure that you have everything you need to run the tests
by doing in the root directory

::

   pip install .[develop]

this command installs the necessary dependencies for developing
and running the tests. Look inside of the file ``setup.py`` for
further information.

You can also look at the folder ``tools`` for scripts used in the
CI testing phase for further context.
