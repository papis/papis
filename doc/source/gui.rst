Papis is a program mainly intended for the command line, however,
some experimental frontends have been conceived for it and are
already downloadable from pip.

See for instance

- `papis-rofi <https://papis_rofi.readthedocs.io/>`__
- `papis-dmenu <https://papis_dmenu.readthedocs.io/>`__


And more to come!
