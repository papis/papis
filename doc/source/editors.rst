Editor support
==============

There are some plugins for the major open source editors ``vim``, ``neovim`` and
``emacs``.

Vim and Neovim
--------------

There is a new well-maintained and high-quality package for Neovim
`papis.nvim <https://github.com/jghauser/papis.nvim>`__.

If Neovim is a deal breaker for you, you can take a look at the
original ``vim`` plugin `papis-vim <https://github.com/papis/papis-vim>`__.

Emacs
-----

`papis.el <https://github.com/papis/papis.el>`__ is a compatibility layer for
Papis that tries to use as much of the existing Emacs ecosystem as possible. It
seamlessly integrates with ``org-ref`` and ``org-cite`` while keeping your Papis
library intact.
