Papis is a command\-line based document and bibliography manager. Its
command\-line interface (\fICLI\fP) is heavily tailored after
\fI\%Git\fP\&.
.SH QUICK START
.sp
This is a tutorial that should be enough to get you started using papis.  Papis
tries to be as simple and lightweight as possible, therefore its database
structure is ridiculously simple.
.sp
But before taking a look at its database structure let us see how is the daily
usage of papis for a regular user. This tutorial is command\-line based, so you
should be familiar with opening a terminal window in your system.
.SS Creating a new library
.sp
We will illustrate the process by creating a first library with a couple of
\fB\(gapdf\(ga\fP documents in it. Papis can be highly configured using configuration
files. Many programs use configuration files without you maybe being aware of
it. Papis\(aq configuration files are stored together inside the folder
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
~/.config/papis
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Bear in mind that \fB~\fP means "Home Directory". Inside this directory a
configuration file is found,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
~/.config/papis/config
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Right now we will open this file to edit and we will create a library.  In
papis everything should be human\-readabale and human\-editable. So adding a
library is as easy as adding two lines to this configuration file.
.sp
Say that you want to create a "papers" library, where you can finally order
all those pdf\(aqs hanging around in your computer. We can create this library
by putting inside the config file the two lines:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[papers]
dir = ~/Documents/mypapers
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the above lines we have created a library with the name \fBpapers\fP which is
located in the directory \fB~/Documents/mypapers\fP\&.  So all the documents that
we will be adding to the library will be located inside
\fB~/Documents/mypapers\fP, and nowhere else. Everything that papis needs to take
care of your papers library is inside the \fB~/Documents/mypapers\fP directory,
self\-contained.
.sp
So now add the two lines to the \fB~/.config/papis/config\fP file and save it, and we will
proceed to add some documents.
.SS Adding the first document
.sp
If you don\(aqt have any special pdf lying around let me choose one for you:
\fI\%link\fP\&.
You can download this document and we are going to add it into the \fBpapers\fP
library.
.sp
Supposing that you have the document in the current directory and you have renamed
the document to \fBdocument.pdf\fP, you can do the following to add this into your
library:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis add document.pdf \-\-author "Newton" \-\-title "Principia Mathematica"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And it\(aqs done! We have added our first book to the library.
.sp
Let us see how this works exactly. Papis consists of many commands, and one of
these commands is \fBadd\fP\&. \fBAdd\fP itself has many flags, which are options for the
given command. In the example above we have used the flags \fBauthor\fP and
\fBtitle\fP to tell papis to use \fBNewton\fP as the author\(aqs name and \fBPrincipia
Mathematica\fP as the document\(aqs title. You can see all the posible flags
for the command \fBadd\fP if you use the \fBhelp\fP flag, i.e., if you issue the
following command
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis add \-\-help
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now you are asking yourself, what happened to the pdf file? Where it is
stored?  Is it stored in an obscure database somewhere in my computer? No,
papis just copied the \fBdocument.pdf\fP file into a folder inside the library
folder \fB~/Documents/papers/\fP\&. If you go now there, you will see that a folder
with a weird name has been created. Inside of the folder there is the
\fBdocument.pdf\fP file and another file, \fBinfo.yaml\fP\&.
.sp
If you open the \fBinfo.yaml\fP file you will see the following contents:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
author: Newton
title: Principia Mathematica
files:
\- document.pdf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This file is all that papis uses to store the information of your newly added
document. It is stored in a nicely readable \fI\%yaml\fP format.
.sp
Now you already have your first document, and.. you can open it!
Just do
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis open
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and the document should just open in your default pdf viewer.
You can change the default pdf viewer in your configuration file
(see section on configuration\-file).
.sp
Now you can try to repeat the same process with another pdf file lying around.
When you hit \fBpapis open\fP again, it will ask you which one you want.
If you input parts of the title or the author\(aqs name it will try to match
what you typed with the paper you are looking for, so that you can get the
paper that you are looking for very easily.
.sp
Nice Reading!!
.SH INSTALLATION
.SS Using pip
.sp
The easiest way of installing papis is using the \fBPyPi\fP repositories and
the package manager \fBpip3\fP, just open a terminal and type in
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.UNINDENT
.sp
or download the \fI\%zip file\fP\&.
.sp
Go inside of the \fBpapis\fP source folder and you can either use the \fBMakefile\fP
or install it with \fBpython3\fP\&.
.SS Using the Makefile
.sp
If you want to install it globally, just hit
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo make install
.ft P

\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you install the package locally, the program \fBpapis\fP will be installed
by default into your \fB~/.local/bin\fP direcrtory, so that you will have to
set your \fBPATH\fP accordingly.
.sp
One way of doing this in \fBbash\fP shells (\fBLinux\fP and the like, also
\fBUbuntu\fP on Windows or \fBcygwin\fP) is by adding the following line to your
\fB~/.bashrc\fP file
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SS Requirements
.sp
Papis needs the following packages that are sometimes not installed with the
system \fBpython3\fP distribution
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
python3\-ncurses
python3\-setuptools
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However if you have a general enough python distribution they should be installed.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.sp
Papis uses a configuration file in \fIINI\fP format. You can then have
several libraries which work independently from each other.
.sp
For example, maybe you want to have one library for papers and the other
for some miscellaneous documents. An example for that is given below
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[papers]
dir = ~/Documents/papers

[settings]
editor = vim
default\-library = papers

[books]
dir = ~/Documents/books
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A more complete example of a configuration file is the following
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

header\-format = > {doc[title]:<70.70}|{doc[author]:<20.20} ({doc[year]:\-<4})

# Commands that will be run when one does papis run ...
# e.g., papis run gagp will run the command below in the library folder

.SS Local configuration files
.sp
Papis also offers the possibility of creating local configuration files.
The name of the local configuration file can be configured with the
\fBlocal\-config\-file\fP setting.
.sp
The local configuration file can be found in the current directory of
where you are issuing the papis command or in the directory of the
library that you are considering in the papis command.
.sp
For instance let us suppose that you are in some project folder
\fB~/Documents/myproject\fP and you have a local config file there
with a definition of a new library. Then whenever you are
in the \fB~/Documents/myproject\fP directory papis will also source the
local configuration file found there.
.sp
On the other hand, also if you have a configuration file in the library folder
for your papers, for instance in
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
~/Documents/papers/.papis.config
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
then everytime that you use this library also papis will source this
configuration file.

.SH THE INFO.YAML FILE
.sp
At the heart of papis there is the information file.  The info file contains
all information about the documents.
.sp
It uses the \fI\%yaml\fP syntax to store
information, which is a very human readable language. It is quite format free,
\fIpapis\fP does not assume that any special information should be there.
.sp
If you are storing papers with papis, then you most probably would like to
store author and title in there,

.SH THE DATABASE
.sp
One of the things that makes papis interesting is the fact
that its database is \fIno database\fP\&.
.sp
A papis library is linked to a directory, where all the documents are (and
possibly sublibraries).  What papis does is simply to go to the library folder
and look for all subfolders that contain a information file, which by default
is a \fBinfo.yaml\fP file.
.sp
Every subfolder that has an \fBinfo.yaml\fP file in it is a valid papis document.
As an example let us consider the following library
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

The first thing that you might notice is that there are really many folders of
course. Just to check that you undeerstand exactly what is a document, just
please think about which of these pdfs is not a valid papis document... That\(aqs
right!, \fBfolder1/paper.pdf\fP is not a valid document since the folder1 does not
contain any \fBinfo.yaml\fP file. You see also that it does not matter how deep the
folder structure is, you can have in your library a \fBphysics\fP folder, where you
have a \fBnewton\fP folder, where also you have a folder containing the actual book
\fBdocument.pdf\fP plus some supplementary information \fBsupplements.pdf\fP\&.  In this
case inside the \fBinfo.yaml\fP you would have the following \fBfile\fP section
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
files:
\- document.pdf
\- supplements.pdf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
so that you are telling papis that in this folder there are two relevant files.
.SS Cache system
.sp
The fact that there is no database means that papis should crawl through
the library folder and see which folders have an \fBinfo.yaml\fP file, which
is for slow computers quite bad.
.sp
Papis implements a very rudimentary caching system. A cache is created for
every library. Inside the cache only the paths to the different valid papis
documents is stored. These cache files are stored in
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
~/.cache/papis/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some papis commands clear the cache automatically, for example the \fBadd\fP and
\fBrm\fP command clear the cache when something is changed.
.SS Disabling the cache
.sp
You can disable the cache using the configuration setting \fBuse\-cache\fP
and set it to \fBFalse\fP, e.g.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[settings]

use\-cache = False

[books]
# Use cache for books but don\(aqt use for the rest of libraries
use\-cache = True
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Clearing the cache
.sp
To clear the cache for a given library you can use the flag
\fB\-\-clear\-cache\fP, e.g.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis \-\-clear\-cache

.SS Config
.sp
The command config is a useful command because it allows you to check
the configuration settings\(aq values that your current \fIpapis\fP session
is using.
.sp
For example let\(aqs say that you want to see which \fBdir\fP setting your
current library is using (i.e., the directory or the dir that appears
in the definition of the library in the configuration file), then you
would simply do:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis config dir
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you wanted to see which \fBdir\fP the library \fBbooks\fP has, for example
then you would do
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis \-l books config dir
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This works as well for default settings, i.e., settings that you have not
customized, for example the setting \fBmatch\-format\fP, you would check
it with
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SH QUERY LANGUAGE
.sp
Since version \fI0.3\fP there is a query language in place for the searching
of documents. To illustrate it here are some examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Open documents where the author key matches \(aqalbert\(aq (ignoring case),
year matches \(aq19\(aq (i.e., 1990, 2019, 1920):
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis open \(aqauthor = albert year = 05\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Add the restriction to the previous search that the usual matching matches
the substring \(aqlicht\(aq in addition to the previously selected
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis open \(aqauthor = albert year = 05 licht\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is not to be mixed with the restriction that the key \fIyear\fP matches
\fI\(aq05 licht\(aq\fP, which will not match any year, i.e.
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.SH CUSTOM SCRIPTS
.sp
As in \fI\%git\fP, you can write custom scripts to
include them in the command spectrum of papis.
.SS Example: Mail script
.sp
Imagine you want to write a script to send papers to someone via the email
client \fBmutt\fP (you can try to do it with another mail client), you could
write the following script called \fBpapis\-mail\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#! /usr/bin/env bash
# papis\-short\-help: Email a paper to my friend

folder_name=$1
zip_name="${folder_name}\&.zip"

papis \-l ${PAPIS_LIB} export \-\-folder \-\-out ${folder_name}
zip \-r ${zip_name} ${folder_name}

mutt \-a ${zip_name}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Papis defines environment variables such as \fBPAPIS_LIB\fP so that external
scripts can make use of the user input.
.sp
To use the script you can put it somewhere in your \fBPATH\fP or alternatively
inside the \fB~/.papis/scripts\fP folder. If this is the case then you can run
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis \-h
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and you will see that there is another command besides the default
called \fBmail\fP\&. You will see in fact
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
positional arguments:
  command               For further information for every command, type in \(aqpapis <command> \-h\(aq
    add                 Add a document into a given library
    .............       ..........................
    mail                Email a paper to my friend

optional arguments:
  \-h, \-\-help            show this help message and exit
  ... .........         .... ... ...... ....... ........... .. ..... ......
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where the description \fBEmail a paper to my friend\fP is there because
we have defined the comment \fB# papis\-short\-help: Email a paper to my friend\fP
in the header of the script.
.sp
Then if you type
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis \-l mylib mail this_paper
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
this will create a folder called \fBthis_paper\fP with a selection of a
document, zip it, and send it to whoever you choose to.
.SS Example: Accessing papis from within mutt
.sp
You may want to pick documents to attach to your email in \fBmutt\fP
from the papis interface.
.sp
Add this code to your \fBmuttrc\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# # macro to attach paper from papis
macro attach,compose \ecp \e
"\e
<enter\-command>unset wait_key<enter>\e                        # Don\(aqt require \(aqpress any key\(aq
<shell\-escape>rm \-f /tmp/paper.pdf<enter>\e                   # remove the file /tmp/paper.pdf if it already exists
<shell\-escape>papis export \-\-file \-o /tmp/paper.pdf<enter>\e  # start papis with the \-\-file flag
<attach\-file>/tmp/paper.pdf<enter>\e                          # attach the new file created by papis
"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Try it out with \fBCtrl\-p\fP on your \fBCompose\fP screen. This makes use
of the \fBpapis export \-\-file\fP flag that moves the paper you choose to
a temporary location (\fB/tmp/paper.pdf\fP). Mutt will then attach the
paper to the email, which you can rename to be more descriptive with
\fBR\fP\&.

.SH GIT
.sp
Papis is conceived to work well with the tool \fIgit\fP, this would also work with
\fI\%mercurial\fP
or \fI\%subversion\fP\&.
.sp
Here you will find a description of a possible workflow using git with papis.
This is not the only workflow, but it is the most obvious.
.sp
Let\(aqs say you have a library named \fBbooks\fP in the directory
\fB~/Documents/MyNiceBooks\fP\&. You could turn the \fBbooks\fP library into
a \fIgit\fP repository, just doing for example
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis \-l books run git init
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or just going to the library directory and running the command there:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cd ~/Documents/MyNiceBooks
git init
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now you can add everything you have in the library with \fBgit add .\fP
if you are in the library\(aqs directory or
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis \-l books git add .
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
if you want to do it using the \fIpapis\fP\(aq \fBgit\fP command.
.SS Interplay with other commands
.sp
Some papis commands give you the opportunity of using \fBgit\fP to manage
changes. For instance if you are adding a new document, you could use
the \fB\-\-commit\fP flag to also add a commit into your library, so if you do
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis add \-\-author "Pedrito" \-\-title "Super book" book.pdf \-\-commit
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
then also papis will do an automatic commit for the book, so that you can
push your library afterwards to a remote repository.
.sp
You can imagine that papis command like \fBrename\fP and \fBmv\fP should also
offer such functionality, and they indeed do through the \fB\-\-git\fP flag.
Go to their documentation for more information.
.SS Updating the libray
.sp
You can use the papis\(aq simple \fBgit\fP wrapper,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
papis git pull
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Usual workflow

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Add the document and commit it, either by \fBgit add \-\-commit\fP

.SH SCIHUB SUPPORT
.sp
Papis has a script that uses the scihub platform to download scientific
papers. Due to legal caution the script is not included directly
as a papis command, and it is written \fBbash\fP\&.
.sp
If you want to use it, you can download it from
\fI\%here\fP
and copy it into your papis script folder.
.sp
Usuar locations for your script folder are
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SH IMPORTING FROM BIBTEX FILES
.sp
Many users will want to import a library from a bibtex file
that another program such as \fBzotero\fP, \fBmendeley\fP or
\fBjabref\fP will have exported. These programs usually have a
field called \fBFILE\fP or \fBfile\fP that points to a path
where the document file can be found.
.sp
To import such a library you can use a script originally
intended for \fBzotero\fP but that is general enought to work
for other programs too.
.sp
To install this script you can copy the file \fBpapis\-zotero\fP in the
repository\(aqs example directory to your papis \fBconfig/scripts\fP directory.
.sp
You can do this automatically issuing the following commands
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
wget \-O ~/.config/papis/scripts/papis\-zotero https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alejandrogallo/papis/master/examples/scripts/papis\-zotero
chmod +x ~/.config/papis/scripts/papis\-zotero

then \fBpapis\-zotero\fP will interpret the path of the \fBFILE\fP entry
as a relative path, so you should run the command where this relative path
makes sense.

.SH IMPORTING FROM ZOTERO SQLITE FILE
.sp
There is also a script that decodes the
\fBzotero.sqlite\fP sqlite file that \fBzotero\fP uses to manage documents
and creates papis Documents out of it.
.sp
This script will retrieve the documents from zotero (be it \fBpdf\fP documents
or else) and important information like tags.

Now you have to go to the directory where zotero saves all the information,
it would look something like this on linux systems:

Maybe the path is slightly different, it may vary from version to version from
zotero.  In the zotero data directory there should be a file called
\fBzotero.sqlite\fP and there might be a \fBstorage\fP directory with
document data inside. These will be used by \fBzotero\-sql\fP to
retrieve information and files from.
.sp
Now you can use the script as

Here are some problems that users have come accross with often:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
When I remove a folder manually in a library or I synchronize manually
the library I do not see the new papers in the library.
\fBAnswer\fP: You probably need to update the cache because papis did not
know anything about your changes in the library since you did it by yourself.
