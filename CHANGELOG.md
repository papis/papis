VERSION v0.13
=============

## Features

### New: Special `papis_id` key ([#449](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/449))

In order to make plugin writing easier we have decided to introduce a
`papis_id` key in the document's info files. This key essentially functions as
a UUID for the document. Many commands have gained support for this, e.g.

    papis list --id query
    papis open papis_id:someid

For more information see the documentation.

**Important**: This change requires updating the database backend. This can be
done by simply clearing the cache using `papis --cc`.

### New: `papis doctor` command ([#421](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/421))

A new `papis doctor` command was introduced that can be used to check that
document information is correct, up to date, or is nicely linted. The command
also supports fixing incorrect information for many cases!

It can be used as

    papis doctor --checks files --explain query

There are several useful checks implemented already (non-exhaustive list):

* `files`: checks that the document files actually exist in the file system.
* `keys-exist`: checks that the provided keys exist in the document.
* `bibtex-type`: checks that the document type is a valid BibTeX type.
* `refs`: checks that the document ref exists and does not contain invalid characters.

For more information see the documentation.

### New: `papis citations` command ([#451](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/451))

A new `papis citations` command was added to handle retrieving citation
information for a document. This includes both papers cited by the document
and those which cite the document itself.

For more information see the documentation.


### New: Add DBLP support ([#489](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/489))

Add support for the [DBLP](dblp.org/) database. The database can now be explored
using

    papis explore dblp -q query pick

and documents can be imported directly using the DBLP key or URL

    papis add --from dblp 'conf/iccg/EncarnacaoAFFGM93'

### Major improvements to the web application ([#424](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/424))

The Papis web application, which can be accessed with `papis serve`, has seen
major development since the last version. It now has support for

* editing of `info.yaml` file of a document (requires `ace.js`).
* viewing document PDF files directly in the browser (requires `pdfjs`).
* viewing LaTeX in titles, abstracts and others (requires `KaTeX`).
* exporting the document to BibTeX.
* showing citations for the document.
* showing errors from `papis doctor`.
* showing a timeline for queried documents.

And many other general interface and robustness improvements.

* Major overhaul of the `papis config` command, which can now show defaults
  and select specific sections ([#454](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/454)).
* Fix shell completion on `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`
  ([#478](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/478)).
* Update the logging format ([#465](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/465)).

  and for better data extraction (
  [#441](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/441)
  [#447](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/447)).
* Avoid downloading files on `papis add` in certain scenarios
  ([#505](https://github.com/papis/papis/pull/505)).

VERSION v0.9
============

## Plugin architecture ##

A new plugin architecture is in place.
For more information please refer to
[the documentation](https://papis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin.html)

## Git interface ##

Now some usual commands have a `--git` flag that lets the command work
alongside git. For instance if the `--git` flag is passed to `papis-edit`,
it will add and commit the `info.yaml` file automatically. The same applies
to `papis-add`, `papis-addto`, `papis-update` and `papis-rm`.

You can activate by default the `--git` flag using the `use-git` configuration
option.
**For devs**: The main functions to implement this interface are found in the
papis module `papis.git`.

## `papis add` ##

- The configuration settings `file-name` and `folder-name` are now
  ```
  add-file-name
  add-folder-name
  ```
  so that they become more readable and understandable.
  Also the flag `--name` is now `--folder-name`.
- The flag `--commit` now has the name `--git`.
- The flag `--dir` now has the more descriptive name `--subfolder`.
- The flag `--no-document` has been finally removed.
- The most notable update is that papis is now able to guess a `doi`
  or `arxiv` id from a pdf that is being added, so the following could work

  ```
  papis add --confirm arxiv-paper.pdf
  ```

  or

  ```
  papis add --confirm some-random-paper.pdf
  ```

  with the `--confirm` flag it will ask if we want to use the `doi` or `arxivid`
  retrieved.
- We can query `crossref` with `--from-crossref` in order to get information
  and add a paper.

## `papis export` ##

- The configuration settings `export-text-format` has been removed along with
  the export --text command. papis now support plugins so you should write your
  own instead.
- The flags --bibtex/--json/--yaml of the `export` command have been replaced
  by `export --format=bibtex/json/yaml`
- The flag `--file` has been removed, if you want to export the related files
  then just either export the folder or write a small script for it.

## `papis explore` ##

- Change the flags for `papis explore export` to match the `papis export`
  command.

## `papis list` ##

- Add `-n, --notes` flags to list notes.
- Remove the `--pick` flag and add the `--all` flag to be consistent with the
  behaviour of other commands.
- Remove the query argument in the `run` function for consistency with other
  commands.

## `papis browse` ##

- Add `--all` flag, improve tests and log.

## Databases ##


- The default `papis` database is now caching the document objects instead
  of only the paths, which means that no yaml parsing is necessary every
  time, which makes it around `10x` faster than in version `v0.8`.
  For a library of 1200 documents, the speed of the `papis` database backend
  is comparable with the `whoosh` backend.
- The query language for the default `papis` database has changed, now
  the setter character is `:` instead of `=` to better conform with other
  common database engines like `whoosh` or `xapian`. For instance, before
  ```
  papis open 'author=einstein year=1905'
  ```
  and now it will be
  ```
  papis open 'author:einstein year:1905'
  ```
- Libraries can have multiple directories defined.

## Configuration ##

- A `~/.config/papis/config.py` python file has been added which is
  sourced after the `~/.config/papis/config` file has been processed.
  This should enable some users to have more granularity in the customization.

## Downloaders ##

- Some downloaders have been improved and a `fallback` downloader has
  been added. Now you will be able to retrieve information
  from many more websites by by virtue of the metadata of html websites.

VERSION v0.8.1
==============

- Change default colors for `header_formater`.
- Update `prompt_toolkit` version to `2.0.5`.

  - `frontiersin.org`
  - `hal.fr`
