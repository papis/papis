VERSION v0.9
============

## Add command ##
- The configuration settings `export-text-format` has been removed along with
  the export --text command. papis now support plugins so you should write your
  own instead.
- The flags --bibtex/--json/--yaml of the `export` command have been replaced
  by `export --format=bibtex/json/yaml`

- The configuration settings `file-name` and `folder-name` are now
  ```
  add-file-name
  add-folder-name
  ```
  so that they become more readable and understandable.
  Also the flag `--name` is now `--folder-name`.
- The flag `--dir` now has the more descriptive name `--subfolder`.
- The flag `--no-document` has been finally removed.
- The most notable update is that papis is now able to guess a `doi`
  or `arxiv` id from a pdf that is being added, so the following could work

  ```
  papis add --confirm arxiv-paper.pdf
  ```

  or

  ```
  papis add --confirm some-random-paper.pdf
  ```

  with the `--confirm` flag it will ask if we want to use the `doi` or `arxivid`
  retrieved.
- We can query `crossref` with `--from-crossref` in order to get information
  and add a paper.
- A `--smart` or `-S` flag is added in order to add in a smart way information
  about the paper. Right now it guesses the title from the `filepath`
  and tries to search `crossref` and prompt the user to pick a document.

## Databases ##


- The default `papis` database is now caching the document objects instead
  of only the paths, which means that no yaml parsing is necessary every
  time, which makes it around `10x` faster than in version `v0.8`.
  For a library of 1200 documents, the speed of the `papis` database backend
  is comparable with the `whoosh` backend.
- Libraries can have multiple directories defined.

## Configuration ##

- A `~/.config/papis/config.py` python file has been added which is
  sourced after the `~/.config/papis/config` file has been processed.
  This should enable some users to have more granularity in the customization.
